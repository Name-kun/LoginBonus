# LoginBonus
## What's this?
This is the plugin that gives the bonus (which can be changed from the config file) to the player who joined the server.
## What's amazing?
・All messages can be changed from config.yml  
・The Time when the plugin gives the bonus and The Commands what it executes can be customized from config.yml afterward.  
・Supports UUID! (It's great because we don't have to be afraid of players changing their display name.)  
## By the way, is there a demand?
・I don't know whether this plugin has it or not, but I bet this is my masterpiece plugin.  
(Please introduce this to your server!)
  
## Installation
1. Deploy this plugin to your plugin folder.  
2. Make the server load this plugin and generate files to configure itself.  
3. Open the config.yml and then add the commands whatever you want to make the server execute when the players joined  
(and set the time when the plugin gives the bonus).  
4. Execute the reload command: /loginbonus reload

## Commands
**/loginbonus reload**: reloads the configuration.  
**/loginbonus delete**: deletes the player list (so to execute this command, plugin will be able to give you the bonus again.)
