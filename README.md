# LoginBonus
## What's this?
This is the plugin that gives the bonus (which can be changed from the config file) to the player who joined the server.
## What's amazing?
・All messages can be changed from config.yml  
・The Time when the plugin gives the bonus and The Commands what it executes can be customized from config.yml afterward.  
・Supports UUID! (It's great because we don't have to be afraid of players changing their display name.)  
## By the way, is there a demand?
・I don't know whether this plugin has it or not, but I bet this is my masterpiece plugin.  
(Please introduce this to your server!)
